## üìê Architecture & Data Flow

The FocusFlow architecture uses a client-heavy approach for real-time AI processing, allowing the server to focus on robust data management and content delivery.

1.  **Content Management**: Users create playlists with one of three privacy settings (Public, Unlisted, Private) and can add other users as subscribers to unlisted playlists.
2.  **AI-Powered Ingestion**: When a video is added, the server fetches its transcript and uses the **Google Gemini API** to pre-generate a full set of quizzes and summaries, which are then stored in the database.
3.  **Client-Side AI**: The engagement detection model (`.onnx` format) runs **entirely on the client's machine** for real-time, low-latency analysis.
4.  **Analytics Sync**: The client collects engagement data and sends it to the server in batches, where it's logged for user analytics.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The entire FocusFlow application (client, server, and database) can be run using Docker for a quick and easy setup.

| Service    | Docker Image                             | Command to Run                                  |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Database** | `somejon/focusflow-postgres`             | `docker run -p 5432:5432 somejon/focusflow-postgres` |
| **Server** | `somejon/focus-flow:latest`              | `docker pull somejon/focus-flow:latest`           |
| **Client** | `renanbazinin/focus-flow-client:latest`  | `docker pull renanbazinin/focus-flow-client:latest` |

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these instructions to run the server locally for development.

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Python 3.9+
- Docker
- Google Gemini API Key
- Google Account "App Password"

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/The-JAR-Team/focus-flow-server.git](https://github.com/The-JAR-Team/focus-flow-server.git)
cd focus-flow-server
```

### **3. Launch the Database**
Start the pre-configured PostgreSQL container.
```bash
docker run -p 5432:5432 somejon/focusflow-postgres
```

### **4. Set Up Python Environment**
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **5. Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your credentials.

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER= # User from the Docker image
DB_PASSWORD= # Password from the Docker image
DB_NAME= # DB Name from the Docker image
DB_PORT=5432
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
MODE=norm
GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL="your_gmail_address@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your_gmail_app_password"
APP_CONFIRMATION_URL_BASE=http://localhost:5000
APP_CONFIRMATION_ENDPOINT=/api/confirm_email
SITE_LOGIN_URL= # URL to your frontend login page
PROXY_HTTP=http://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port>
PROXY_HTTPS=https://<proxy_address>:<proxy_port>
```

### **6. Run the Server**
```bash
flask run
```
The server is now live at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
